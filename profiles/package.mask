# There is nothing wrong with dev-util/pyrep, but I hope that this mask will
# make people aware about the successor project dev-util/replacer which is
# probably better in almost any aspect. In addition, dev-util/pyrep is almost
# unmaintained (and really old ugly code). Anyway, feel free to numask...
