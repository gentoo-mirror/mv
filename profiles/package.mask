# There is nothing wrong with sys-fs/squash_dir: It will stay in this overlay,
# although upstream maintenance is decreased and might eventually be dropped.
# For the moment, it is completely save to unmask sys-fs/squash_dir.
# However, this mask is here to call to your attention that it is recommended
# to use the successor sys-fs/squashmount instead (or sys-apps/openrc-wrapper
# if you wanted squash_dir only because of the openrc-wrapper script)
sys-fs/squash_dir
