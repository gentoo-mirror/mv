app-cdr/cdrtools:schily-tools - Use libschily from app-shells/schily-tools
app-portage/eix:debug - Build with upstream's CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS for debugging support; not recommended for normal use.
app-portage/eix:dep - Make DEP=true the default which enables support for {,R,P}DEPEND but requires roughly double disk and memory.
app-portage/eix:doc - Create description of the eix cache file additionally in html format
app-portage/eix:meson - Build with meson instead of autotools. Faster but less compatible
app-portage/eix:optimization - Accept upstream's choices for CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS for optimization. Absense of this USE flag does not strip user's *FLAGS
app-portage/eix:required-use - Make REQUIRED_USE=true the default which enables support for REQUIRED_USE but requires more disk and memory.
app-portage/eix:security - This adds some checks which can prevent certain exploits if e.g. the eix code has a bug. If you use the hardened toolchain, using this flag does not increase security and can even lead to problems.
app-portage/eix:sqlite - Compile in support for portage's sqlite backend; to actually use it you need additional configuration of portage and eix
app-portage/eix:strong-optimization - Adds several more agressive CXXFLAGS/LDFLAGS for optimization like graphite (if available). May cause trouble with some buggy compiler versions. Absense of this USE flag does not strip user's *FLAGS
app-portage/eix:strong-security - Add many checks to prevent exploits if eix code has a bug. This will slow down eix considerably. Use only if you are paranoid or have reasons to suspect a bug.
app-portage/eix:swap-remote - Swap role of remote addresses in eix-remote, making the data from gpo.zugaina.org the first choice.
app-portage/eix:tools - Create separate binary for script helper tools; useful if they are called extremely often
app-portage/portage-bashrc-mv:ccache - Install a script for CCACHE_* variable support. This requires dev-util/ccache
app-portage/portage-bashrc-mv:cflags - Install a script for /etc/portage/package.cflags support. Requires app-portage/eix for fast parsing
app-portage/portage-bashrc-mv:localepurge - Install a script to remove unneeded locales. Requires the config files of app-admin/localepurge
app-portage/portage-bashrc-mv:remove-la - Install a script to remove unneeded .ls files
app-portage/portage-bashrc-mv:title - Install a script to display the expected merge time. Requires app-portage/portage-utils and app-shells/runtitle
app-portage/portage-postsyncd-mv:portage-utils - Make /etc/portage/repo.postsync.d/q-reinit from app-portage/portage-utils non-executable and install a hack in /etc/portage/env/app-portage/portage-utils so that it stays so
app-shells/auto-fu-zsh:compile - Byte-compile to speed up. Do not use this if you are cross-compiling
