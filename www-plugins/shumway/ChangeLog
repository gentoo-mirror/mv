*shumway-0.10.337 (01 Apr 2015)

  01 Apr 2015; Martin Väth <martin@mvath.de>:
  new version from scratch. Since mozilla does not version the tarball,
  and I do not bump very often, you will likely get checksum errors
  when downloading.
  It is necessary to copy the ebuild (probably together with the
  mv_mozextension.eclass) in your local overlay and bump on your own.
  Blame mozilla for this broken policy but not me...
